# Calcium-Imaging-Behavior-GUI

Offline visualization GUI for the synchronized recordings of neural activity and behavior buit on the Tkinter framework. This is a useful for getting a quick visulaization of your time evolving traces as they may relate to different beahvior motifs. In the siegelbaum lab I am looking into familiar vs. novel mediated aggression. I supply an example video and dataframe as an example/
The user is prompted for:
  - An TXN dataframe that was synced to a corresponding beahvior video with time in frame as the index (T) and neural vectors (N)
  - A reference to the corresponding video
  - Frame rate of the collected neural activity

Let me know if you have any issues : av2686@columbia.edu
